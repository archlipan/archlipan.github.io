TouchDelegateï¼š

> Helper class to handle situations where you want a view to have a larger touch area than its actual view bounds. The view whose touch area is changed is called the delegate view. This class should be used by an ancestor of the delegate. To use a TouchDelegate, first create an instance that specifies the bounds that should be mapped to the delegate and the delegate view itself.
