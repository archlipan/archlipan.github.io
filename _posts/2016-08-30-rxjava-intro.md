>  In reactive programming the consumer reacts to the data as it comes in. This is the reason why asynchronous programming is also called reactive programming. Reactive programming allows to propagates event changes to registered observers.

> RxJava provides Observables and Observers. Observables can send out values. Observers, watch Observables by subscribing to them. Observers are notified when an Observable emits a value, when the Observable says an error has occurred. They are also notified when the	Observable sends the information that it no longer has any values to emit.

#### Observable Create

*  Observable.just()

* Observable.from()

* Observable.fromCallable()
