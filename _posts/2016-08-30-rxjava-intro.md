>  RxJava is a Java VM implementation of ReactiveX (Reactive Extensions): a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.

> ReactiveX is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.     
> The ReactiveX Observable model allows you to treat streams of asynchronous events with the same sort of simple, composable operations that you use for collections of data items like arrays. It frees you from tangled webs of callbacks, and thereby makes your code more readable and less prone to bugs.

>  In reactive programming the consumer reacts to the data as it comes in. This is the reason why asynchronous programming is also called reactive programming. Reactive programming allows to propagates event changes to registered observers.

> RxJava provides Observables and Observers. Observables can send out values. Observers, watch Observables by subscribing to them. Observers are notified when an Observable emits a value, when the Observable says an error has occurred. They are also notified when the	Observable sends the information that it no longer has any values to emit.

#### Observable Create

*  Observable.just()

* Observable.from()

* Observable.fromCallable()
